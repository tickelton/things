=======================

A laser cut replica of the [Confederate Cipher Disk](https://cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/ccd/index.htm).

There are two versions of the cipher disk, a 2 piece (2pc) and a 3 piece (3pc) version.

The 3 piece version consists of a base plate, and outer ring and an inner disk.
The ring needs to be glued to the base plate. The inner disk can then be placed
inside the ring an move freely without any need for further fixation.
This version works well with all sufficiently thick materials like wood or acrylic.
The wooden example in the picture was made using the 3 piece template.

The 2 piece version has two base layers that are always required and two optional layers 
of which only one is needed.
The base layers "cut" and "engrave" are used to create the two cipher disks.

The optional layer "center holes" is used to cut concentric holes into the disks so
they can be mounted together using a screw or pin. This works well for all materials
but is particularly useful with paper or cardboard. The cardboard example in the
picture was made with the 2 piece template and the "center holes" layer.

The optional layer "deep engrave", when used with an appropriate laser setting like
Visicut's "engrave_3d" , creates a circular pocket in the larger disc in which the
smaller disk can reside and turn freely without additional fixation.
This version is primarily intended for use with acrylic. The yellow acrylic example
in the picture was made this way.
