Fruit/Vegetable Rack
====================

Pattern for a laser cut fruit/vegetable rack.

The rack is designed to be cut from 3.5mm acrylic or plywood.

The pattern requires 3 400x300mm sheets for the main rack and about 170x70mm of scrap
material for the braces.

The rack can be build with a full back plate, a half back plate or only a set of
brackets (see the correspondingly named layers in the SVG).
The brackets use the least material and work well with stiff materials like MDF and
some kinds of acrylic.
For more flexible materials like plywood and most types of acrylic the larger back plates
are recommended.
