Pill Box
========

A simple pill box laser cut from acrylic.

There are two designs:

pill_box_large.svg has 23x29mm compartments and is designed so that
all parts can be cut from 3mm acrylic.

pill_box_small.svg has 21x23mm compartments. The box itself is also
designed for 3mm acrylic but the compartment dividers are to be
cut from 1mm material (e.g. acrylic or cardboard).

In both cases the pegs on the lid have to be slightly rounded by
hand (with sandpaper or a file) to fit the round holes in the
side wall.
Alternatively the holes could be enlarged by 0.5mm to accept
the square pegs without modification which would result in
slightly less smooth movement of the lid.
