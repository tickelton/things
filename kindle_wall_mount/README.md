![kindle_wall_mount.jpg](kindle_wall_mount/kindle_wall_mount.jpg)

Template for a Kindle Paperwhite wall mount.

The mount is designed to be cut from 3mm or 1/16th inch plywood.  
It consists of a face plate and 6 side pieces (3 per side) that
need to be glued together with wood glue.

The Templates do not include the screw holes shown in the example picture
as the mount was originally designed to be glued to the wall.

In the picture the mount is attached to a bed headrest.
