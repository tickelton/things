Floppy Disk Coasters
====================

These are laser cutter templates for a set of coasters in the shapes of
3.5", 5.25" and 8" floppy disks.

The SVG files contain two layers named "cut" and "engrave" that respectively
contain the paths to be cut and engraved.

The 3.5" file contains three layers. One "cut" layer and separate engraving
layers for wood and acrylic of the appropriate one has to be selected.
In principle both versions work with any material but on the acrylic version
some of the areas (e.g. the label) are inverted since that looks better
on transparent acrylic.

The final result can be seen in the example image "floppy_disk_coasters.jpg".
