A laser cut gauge to measure bevel angles of knife and tool edges

The SVG file consists of two versions of the gauge. One with fewer
and larger angles (pictured above) that is suitable for the
vast majority of general purpose knives and one with more
and smaller angles that should also work for several types
of specialized knives like woodcarving knives and straight razors.
