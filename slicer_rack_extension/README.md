Mandoline slicer blade rack extension
=====================================

This piece adds an additional level to the blade rack that comes with
the Chef's Inspirations Premium V-Blade Mandoline Slicer.

The slicer comes with 6 blades but the original rack only has space
for 5 blades. So one always has to store one blade in the slicer.

Additionally the grater blade is slightly taller than the other blades
and does not fit into the rack at all.

This extension adds a 6th level to the rack that is tall enough to
fit the grater blade so that all blades can comfortably be stored
in the rack.

The extension is intentionally designed for a relatively loose fit
since the racks themselves are occasionally a little warped and
dimensions vary slightly between individual exemplars.
